Should video game developers be more considerate over their use of symbolism in their games?

Examples: 

Bungie removed "kek" 'hate symbol' from Destiny 2
No swastikas in CoD: WWII


Do video games desensitize younger audiences to real world violence?

Examples:

Grand Theft Auto games
Battlefield games
